# Task Manager Pro

Because apparently, we can't remember to buy milk without an app anymore. 🥛

A task manager built with vanilla JavaScript. Yes, VANILLA. No React, no Vue, no Angular. Just raw, unfiltered JavaScript like our ancestors intended. If you're looking for 47 npm packages and a 500MB node_modules folder, this ain't it chief.

## What Does This Thing Do?

It's a to-do list. Groundbreaking, I know. 🙄

- Add tasks (revolutionary concept)
- Mark them done (when you actually do things)
- Delete them (when you give up on your dreams)
- Filter them (because you're fancy like that)
- See stats (to feel productive while procrastinating)
- Save everything in localStorage (your browser is basically your therapist now)

**Fun fact:** This app has exactly ONE file. That's it. One HTML file. Your webpack config has more files than this entire project.

## Live Demo

[Click here](https://abhiraj7575.github.io/to-do-list/) to procrastinate in style.

## Installation

This is the easiest part of your day:

1. Download the file
2. Open it in a browser
3. That's it. No `npm install`. No `yarn`. No waiting for 10 minutes while your laptop sounds like a jet engine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-pro.git
cd task-manager-pro
# Now just open index.html like it's 2005
```

If you can't figure out how to open an HTML file in 2024, maybe start with a different hobby. 🤷

## Tech Stack (LOL)

- **HTML** - The OG
- **CSS** - Making things pretty since forever
- **JavaScript** - No frameworks were harmed in the making of this project
- **localStorage** - Your browser's basement where we hide your data

**Total bundle size:** One file. That's it. Your morning coffee has more complexity.

## Why Should You Care?

- It actually works (shocking, right?)
- No build process (what's webpack? 🤔)
- No dependencies (npm what?)
- Loads faster than you can say "create-react-app"
- Your grandma could deploy this

## Features Nobody Asked For But Got Anyway

- Smooth animations (because we're not animals)
- Glassmorphism (it's like regular morphism but fancier)
- Live stats (for when you need to quantify your procrastination)
- Timestamps (proof that you thought about doing things)
- Mobile responsive (works on your phone while you ignore actual responsibilities)

## Coming Soon™

Maybe. If I feel like it. No promises.

- Task priorities (as if labeling tasks "urgent" makes you do them faster 😂)
- Due dates (to ignore more effectively)
- Dark mode (for coding at 3 AM wondering about your life choices)
- Export to CSV (because spreadsheets make everything look professional)

## Contributing

Found a bug? Cool, me too. PRs welcome. Just don't add React please, I'm begging you.

## License

It's free. Take it. Use it. Learn from it. Just don't blame me if you become too productive.

## Author

Some person who thought "hey, I should make the 47,382nd to-do list app."

Was it necessary? No.  
Did I do it anyway? Obviously.  
Do I have unfinished tasks in this very app? ... next question.
